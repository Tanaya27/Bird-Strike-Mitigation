"Bird Strike Mitigation

In this project, following steps are performed:

"1. Data Collection:
I've gathered a diverse dataset from reputable aviation authorities and wildlife management agencies, ensuring it included relevant information on bird species, environmental conditions, flight data, and historical bird strike incidents.

2. Data Preprocessing:
I systematically cleaned and formatted the dataset, addressing missing values and employing categorical variable encoding. 
Additionally, I standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity and enhanced data quality through the application of outlier detection and removal techniques.

3. Feature Engineering:
I also applied a judicious feature selection process informed by exploratory data analysis and domain expertise. 
Implementing feature engineering techniques such as polynomial features and interaction terms, I aimed to effectively capture non-linear relationships within the dataset.

4. Model Selection:
Carefully selecting three machine learning classifiers—Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting—we based our choices on their established 
efficacy in handling intricate datasets and non-linear relationships.

5. Model Training:
I employed a random split methodology to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. 
Subsequently, I trained each chosen classifier on the designated training set and optimized model parameters through cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

6. Model Evaluation:
Rigorously evaluating the performance of each classifier, we utilized metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. 
I conducted both in-sample and out-of-sample testing to assess the generalization capabilities of the models.

7. Comparative Analysis:
Undertaking a comprehensive comparative analysis, we sought to discern the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each classifier. 
In this assessment, I considered interpretability, computational efficiency, and model complexity as pivotal factors.
